							<p>							
								The reports I made are used in financial decisions as well as policy decisions.
								I have built reports that are used by different departments around campus. 
								This dashboards are used by different department heads as well as their reporesentatives and Support Center agents.
								I worked closely with a team of developers and programmers to wrangle data to then visualize and present it in a meaningful way.
							</p>
							<p>
								I applied the business methods of the company, adjusting the measures for the need of the Support Center.
								As problem were rising, I was able to efficiently solve them with extenal tools such as R and Python embeded in Power BI.
								Our Power BI reports were connected with the university's data warehouse through our <b>SQL Server Analysis Services</b>.
								Big part of the data is gather in our <b>CRM (TeamDynamix)</b> which is connected to the SQL Server.
